# Pros and Cons of Test-Driven Development
# Pros:
-	With TDD, we are writing small tests at a time, so the source code can easily be compartmentalized.
-	TDD helps with documenting code.
-	Makes code easier to maintain and refactor.
-	With TDD, weâ€™ll have very high test coverage and regression tests can be implemented easily.
# Cons:
-	Initially, it slows down development; for rapidly iterative startup environments the implementation code may not be ready for some time due to spending time writing tests first.
-	Hard to apply to existing legacy code.
-	Unless everyone on the team correctly maintains their tests, the whole system can quickly degrade.
